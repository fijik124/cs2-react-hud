### **CS2 React HUD for [LHM.gg](http://LHM.gg)**

CS2 React HUD for [LHM.gg](http://LHM.gg), created by Lexogrine, is an open source Counter-Strike 2 HUD that you can use and modify to your needs. Itâ€™s the core element of building customized CS2 HUDs and spectator overlays for the [LHM.gg](http://LHM.gg) platform.

It comes with a set of default options and features that you can use for creating your unique esport experience.

#### **Keybinds**

**Left Alt + B**  
Makes radar smaller by 20px;

**Left Alt + V**  
Makes radar bigger by 20px;

**Left Alt + C**  
Toggles camera feed

#### **Panel**

LHM HUDs can be configured in HUD Settings when opened in LHM. The schema for this configuration panel is available in `/public/panel.json`.

#### Trivia settings

| Field          | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Trivia title   | `Text`      |
| Trivia content | `Text`      |

#### Display settings

| Field                       | Description  |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |

To download it, simply click here: [**DOWNLOAD CS React HUD for LHM.gg**](https://lhm.gg/download?target=cs2)

#### **Instruction**

##### **Setting up**

Fork this repo, clone it, and then run `npm install` and `npm start`. HUD should start on the 3500 port. For this to work, have LHM.gg open so it will pass CS2 data to the HUD.

##### **Identifying HUD**

In `/public` directory, edit `hud.json` so it fits you - fill HUD's name, author, version, specify the radar and killfeed functionalities. At the end, replace the `thumb.png` with your icon :)

##### **Building & distributing**

To build a version to distribute and move around, in the root directory, run `npm run pack`. It will create the zip file for distribution. Now you can just drag and drop this file into the LHM.gg upload area.

##### **Signing**

To create Signed CS2 HUD for [LHM.gg](http://LHM.gg) to prevent at least from modifying compiled JavaScript files, run `npm run sign`. It's the same as `npm run pack` command but with an additional step of signing `.js` and `.css` files and `hud.json`.

##### **File structure**

The HUD is separated into two parts - the API part, which connects to the LHM.gg API and communicates with it: `src/App.tsx` file and `src/api` directory. Usually, you don't want to play with it, so the whole thing runs without a problem. The second part is the render part - `src/HUD`, `src/fonts` and `src/assets` are the directories you want to modify. In the `src/HUD` each element of the HUD is separated into its own folder. Styles are kept in the `src/HUD/styles`. Names are quite self-explanatory, and to modify the style of the element, you should just find the styling by the file and class name.

##### **panel.json API**

To get the incoming data from the LHM.gg, let's take a look at the `src/HUD/SideBoxes/SideBox.tsx` component:

```typescript
const Sidebox = ({ side, hide }: { side: "left" | "right"; hide: boolean }) => {
  const [image, setImage] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const data = useConfig("display_settings");

  useOnConfigChange(
    "display_settings",
    (data) => {
      if (data && `${side}_image` in data) {
        const imageUrl = `${apiUrl}api/huds/${
          hudIdentity.name || "dev"
        }/display_settings/${side}_image?isDev=${
          hudIdentity.isDev
        }&cache=${new Date().getTime()}`;
        setImage(imageUrl);
      }
    },
    []
  );

  if (!data || !data[`${side}_title`]) return null;
  return (
    <div className={`sidebox ${side} ${hide ? "hide" : ""}`}>
      <div className="title_container">
        <div className="title">{data[`${side}_title`]}</div>
        <div className="subtitle">{data[`${side}_subtitle`]}</div>
      </div>
      <div className="image_container">
        {image ? <img src={image} id={`image_left`} alt={"Left"} /> : null}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

You can just read data from the HUDs settings by using `useConfig` hook. Everything is now strictly typed. If you make a change to the panel or keybinds JSON files, Vite server will automatically generate types for you, so `useConfig` should always be up to date.

If you want to listen for a change in settings, you can use `useOnConfigChange`. In this case, we are using this to force refresh the `src` attribute of the `img` element.

If you want to listen for action input, you can just use `useAction` hook, like here in `Trivia.tsx`:

```typescript
useAction("triviaState", (state) => {
  setShow(state === "show");
});
```

For the action input, we need to import the `actions` object and create a listener with the parameter on it.

##### **keybinds.json API**

Keybinds API works in a very similar way to `panel.json` action API. This time, the example will be from `RadarMaps.tsx`:

```typescript
useAction(
  "radarBigger",
  () => {
    setRadarSize((p) => p + 10);
  },
  []
);

useAction(
  "radarSmaller",
  () => {
    setRadarSize((p) => p - 10);
  },
  []
);
```

##### **Killfeed**

Listening for kills is very easy - we can see that in `src/HUD/Killfeed/Killfeed.tsx`:

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
	GSI.on("kill", kill  => {
		this.addKill(kill);
	});
}
```

The Killfeed component basically just keeps kills in the state during the round, and after the round, it cleans the state. Kills have a CSS animation, which makes them gently show, and after a few seconds, disappear. The experience is very smooth. You can fiddle with the styling in the `killfeed.scss`. This killfeed detects who killed whom, if there was an assist (flash assist as well), used weapon, headshot, and wallbang.

##### **Radar**

Radar is a custom React-based component made by Hubert Walczak and is easily editable from CSS.
